# Backend to recognize

In this backend you can send a request with the image of a base64-decoded arrow and in the response send the orientation. You can also send a request with the image of a base64-decoded face and if the face is the same person that you have in the folder "face_recognition/detector/detec/images/", the response send the name that the person, but if not send null.
